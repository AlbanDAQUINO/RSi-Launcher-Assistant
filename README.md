The script can noe be saved anywhere. You need to have some 'PowerShell' knowledge to be able to use it tho

Your Star Citizen install directory shoud be, usually, something like _"C:\Program Files\Roberts Space Industries"_.

You only need to adjust the variable _'SC_INSTALL_PATH'_ to your directory.

```PowerShell
# 
# User Settings >>> MAKE YOUR CHANGES BELOW HERE <<<
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Star Citizen installation directory
$SC_INSTALL_PATH = "C:\Program Files\Roberts Space Industries"
```

_Shaders_ and _USER_ directory cleaner. **PUF**, gone ...
