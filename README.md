## EN:
The script can now be saved anywhere. You will need to sign it or change your Execution Policy in order to be able to run it.

Usually something like _"C:\Program Files\Roberts Space Industries"_.

You only need to adjust the constant _'SC_INSTALL_PATH '_ to your directory.

```PowerShell
# 
# User Settings >>> MAKE YOUR CHANGES BELOW HERE <<<
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Star Citizen installation directory
$SC_INSTALL_PATH = "C:\Program Files\Roberts Space Industries"
```

_Shaders_ and _USER_ directory cleaner. **PUF**, gone ...

## FR:
...

A venir. Bientot (tm).

Alex.
